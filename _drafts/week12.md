During the past few weeks, we have played with several learning analytics tools, including visualization tools such as Gephi and R Studio. These tools helped us answer the question of “what” the data looks like, and this week we will dive into a new area - Visual Analytics (VA), to think about “why” the data looks like this. Through readings and activities, we will get familiar with the concept of VA and reveal its power to understand your data. VA has been used in many fields, such as business analytics, health care, journalism and education. It requires human involvement and has created the communication between the user and the data.

### ✔️ 4. Activities - Explore visual analytics tools and tell a story of your data

💭 Post your response in Slack \#2019-general channel. Think about how to make your story concise and please feel free to reply to peers.

🔗 **[SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/visual-analytics/demo.html)**

Explore one of the interactive demos, and explore the tools available in the application to see how the data changes, and how these changes can be used to gain new insight into your data.

🔗 **[Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/navigation/reporting)**

Use your own data to create a visualization of your data, and tell a ‘story’ about it on Slack. The story is your explanation of what the data may mean.
